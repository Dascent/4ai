<h2>Image Metadata Reader</h2>

A project created with assistance of [Gemini Ai](https://wiki.dascent-sigils.com/index.php/Ai/Gemini)

Not yet a working project but close enough

<b>There are two versions:</b>

Version one is much simpler and allow user to upload or provide a URL (link) of a hosted image and read its metadata

Second version, also work in progress extends its functionaliy to delete metadata and more extensive reading and displaying an image metadata.

These webApps are not hosting images, it is browser based session.
